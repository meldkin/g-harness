## Decisions

- [decision] 2026-07-28: **rejected Linear (and Notion) for issue tracking**
  -- keep git log + `MEMORY.md`. The deciding evidence is local, not
  opinion: after 9 days of real use `shared_state.db` held `session_log`
  350 rows but `features` **0**, `active_locks` 0, `shared_memory_*` 0.
  `session_log` fills because hooks write it automatically; `features`
  stays empty because it needs a human to call `set_feature_status()` --
  which no executable code ever does. Since a local SQLite table that is
  free, offline and one Python call away still went unused, a tool that
  costs OAuth + network + context window will not fare better. General
  rule extracted: **anything that depends on a human remembering to
  update it will drift.** Corollary for evaluating any future tracker:
  ask whether *work* updates it (git: commit/PR/CI) or a *person* does
  (Linear/Notion) -- git measures progress, trackers only display what
  someone typed. To reopen this, the trigger is a second **person**, not
  a second agent: concurrent agents are already handled by `active_locks`
  (2026-07-26), which trackers cannot do -- they have no file-level
  locking and second-scale latency. Note `active_locks` only works for
  agents on ONE machine (DB is gitignored, local-only); distributed
  humans fall back to branches + PRs. When that day comes, try **GitHub
  Issues first** (remote already exists, `.mcp.json` already documents
  enabling GitHub MCP, and `fixes #N` closes issues automatically -- so
  it lands in the "work updates it" class), and escalate to Linear only
  for cycles/estimates/roadmaps or non-developer teammates. Already
  verified so nobody re-probes it: Linear MCP is
  `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp` (HTTP 401 + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
  realm="OAuth"`, scopes read/write, no API key in config); the older
  `/sse` endpoint is dead (404). Also deleted a vendored 18MB
  `linear-master/` SDK checkout that was untracked AND ungitignored --
  one `git add -A` from entering the repo.

- [decision] 2026-07-26: made Gemini/Antigravity a first-class worker
  alongside Kilo CLI, after two controlled tests. Root problem: the harness
  *pushed* Kilo CLI into every session (`_kilo_available()` + a trigger-rich
  `kilo-cli-delegation` skill) but mentioned Gemini only when a report already
  existed in `outbox/` -- so Gemini was structurally forgotten, not
  forgotten by accident. Fixed by mechanism, not memory: added
  `_gemini_available()` (needs BOTH handoff/inbox AND the IDE installed),
  a `gemini-delegation` SKILL.md, and a routing table in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md.
  Measured payoff: a repo-wide audit cost Gemini ~49.6k tokens of reading vs
  ~2.5k of ours (~20x leverage). Measured limit: BOTH tests shipped an error
  invisible in its own self-summary (1 wrong finding marked "Confident: Yes";
  2 false positives while reporting "unsure: nothing"). Standing rule --
  its evidence is reliable, its self-assessment is not; verify 100%. Also
  killed the `status:` contradiction (plan files are read-only for Gemini;
  the report's existence is the completion signal) and banned re-litigating
  headless access: the SDK has no OAuth path to the Pro plan and
  `antigravity-ide chat` only drives the GUI.

- [decision] 2026-07-23: `.opencode/` deprecated (v3.7.0) — verified via `diff` a
  100% content mirror of `.kilo/` (14 agents, 47 skills); only unique asset
  (`command/ship.md`) ported to `.kilo/command/` + `.claude/commands/`.
  Physical removal planned for v4.0.0. (Superseded by the "Phase 3" physical-
  removal entry in `MEMORY.md` — kept here only as the original announcement.)

- [decision] 2026-07-23: reviewed Anthropic's official Claude Code prompt
  library — ~90% of categories already covered by existing `.kilo/skill/`
  entries; added 2 genuine gaps as new skills: `steering-and-course-
  correction`, `incident-investigation`. Skill count 47->49, synced across
  kilo/claude/copilot (gemini lagged by 3 — flagged as a gap, closed next).

- [decision] 2026-07-23: `tools/deploy.py` manifest trimmed — target projects
  get only RUNTIME harness assets (agents/skills/commands/hooks/config), never
  Solo-Code-CLI's own dev tooling, meta docs, CI workflows, or this repo's
  accumulated memory (blank per-engine templates instead). -21% scaffold size
  (1036->845 files).

- [decision] 2026-07-23: closed the Gemini parity gap — added the missing 3
  skills + 3 instruction files, added `check_gemini()` to `garden.py` (Gemini
  models `.gemini/antigravity/` structure; uses `knowledge/artifacts` instead
  of a MEMORY.md-shaped mirror, so no memory parity check applies there). All
  4 engines now genuinely at parity (49 skills, all instructions).

- [decision] 2026-07-23: re-verified `deploy.py` end-to-end after the day's
  changes; found and fixed one real gap: handoff `inbox/outbox/` accumulated
  task files (`*-plan.md`/`*-report.md`) were NOT excluded from deploy — same
  leak class as the earlier MEMORY.md leak, just not yet triggered. Fixed
  `should_copy()` to exclude task instances while still deploying the empty
  protocol scaffold (README.md, .gitkeep).

- [decision] 2026-07-23: adopted **Kilo CLI** as the cost/latency-optimized
  worker engine, orchestrated by Claude Code. Benchmarked ~2-9x faster startup,
  ~15-63x lower RAM than OpenCode for concurrent workers. No dedicated dir —
  reads `AGENTS.md` + `.claude/skills/` + `.mcp.json` natively. Launch via
  Kilo CLI directly.
- [decision] 2026-07-23: Phase 3 — `.opencode/` physically removed via `git rm`
  (reversible), Kilo CLI installed as the worker engine. Version bumped to
  v4.0.0 across
  `.harness.lock`/`agent.yaml`/`garden.py`/`generate_harness.py`/
  `validate_schemas.py`/docs. `.copilot/memory` synced manually (no
  auto-generator; parity is check-only via `garden.py`). Verified: 0 drift,
  full test suite green on a fresh live scaffold.

- [decision] 2026-07-23: added a `PreCompact` lifecycle hook
  (`.claude/hooks/pre_compact.py`) for context-compaction continuity — logs an
  objective checkpoint (git branch/sha/dirty count) to `.solocode/shared-
  state.db` before every compaction, and reminds Claude via `additionalContext`
  to append any settled decision to `.kilo/memory/MEMORY.md` first. Added a
  required-hook check to `garden.py`'s `check_claude()` + 4 new tests. Kilo Code
  has no equivalent lifecycle event — rule applied manually there instead.
- [decision] 2026-07-23: added a file-based Claude<->Gemini/Antigravity handoff
  protocol (`.gemini/antigravity/handoff/{inbox,outbox}/`, git-tracked audit
  trail, separate from the static `knowledge/` corpus). No headless CLI exists
  for Antigravity, so a human relay step is unavoidable — reduced to "read
  file X, write file Y" instead of copy-pasting. `session_start.py` auto-
  announces new `outbox/*-report.md` files once via a local seen-marker.

- [decision] 2026-07-24: audited the memory system after a direct user
  question ("does SQLite belong in project memory too?"). Found two real
  gaps: (1) `garden.py`'s `check_memory()` only checked filename parity, not
  content — `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` had silently drifted 19 lines behind
  this file (source of truth) with no drift ever reported; (2) Kilo's
  `memory-manager.js` size gate (WARN 4k/HARD 8k chars) was never ported to
  Claude Code, so writes to `.claude/memory/` had no size cap at all — this
  file had already grown past both thresholds (13.4k chars) undetected.
  Fixed both: `check_memory()` now diffs file content byte-for-byte, not just
  existence; added `.claude/hooks/memory_gate.py` (Python port of memory-
  manager.js, exit(2) hard-blocks PostToolUse on Edit/Write/MultiEdit past
  8k chars) wired into `.claude/settings.json` + required in `garden.py`'s
  `check_claude()`. Also compacted this Decisions section itself (verbose
  paragraphs -> concise one-liners; full detail already durable in git commit
  history) to bring all three memory mirrors back under the WARN threshold.
  Confirmed: SQLite (`.solocode/shared-state.db`) is correctly scoped to
  cross-engine coordination state (locks/feature status) only, never
  project memory/decisions — that split is intentional, not a gap.
- [decision] 2026-07-24: removed `docs/specs/` (8 files, obsolete OpenCode
  planning docs + completed plans; history in git log). Fixed real content
  drift in `.copilot`/`.gemini`: both mirrored from an older `.kilo/` and
  never re-synced — missing the Fowler Smell Baseline section in
  `code-review-expert/SKILL.md` + a point in `interview-me/SKILL.md`
  (identical gap in both). Synced body content, kept each engine's own
  frontmatter. `garden.py` now diffs real content:
  `check_skill_content()` (frontmatter-agnostic) + `check_instruction_
  content()` (byte-for-byte). Added `tools/test_garden.py` (14 tests).
- [decision] 2026-07-24: added Context Summary Struct to PreCompact +
  decisions-archive.md tier. `pre_compact.py` asks Claude to write
  `.solocode/context-checkpoint.json` (active_feature, unverified_changes,
  settled_decisions, next_immediate_step); `session_start.py` surfaces it
  once next session then deletes it (recovery aid, not mid-compaction
  survival -- a hook can't guarantee that). Bigger context windows should
  NOT raise MEMORY.md's cap: it's a recurring per-session cost across all 5
  engines (sized for the weakest, Kilo CLI), not a one-time budget. Instead
  added `.kilo/memory/decisions-archive.md` (uncapped, not auto-loaded) --
  pruning now MOVES entries there, not deletes. Also `/debug` now requires
  >=2 hypotheses (all 4 engines). Verified: 0 drift, 107 tests.
- [decision] 2026-07-24: verified Kilo CLI delegation end-to-end (real "pong"
  response); `--tool-profile none --no-selfdev` cuts input tokens ~65%
  (22,376->7,709). Bigger finding: `CLAUDE.md` was NOT actually
  generated from `AGENTS.md` -- `claude_engine.py`'s template is hand-
  written, only parameterized by counts. The earlier Gemini-handoff section
  (added to AGENTS.md) had silently never reached real CLAUDE.md. Fixed:
  added Gemini + Kilo CLI delegation sections into the template + regenerated;
  fixed a stale `tools/test_harness.py` ref (deleted v4.0.0) -> `pytest
  tools/ -q`. Added `_kilo_available()` to `session_start.py`. Also fixed
  CI/Makefile hardcoded test-file allowlist (missed test_garden.py/
  test_integration.py), test_integration.py's machine-specific >=19-feature
  assertion, rewrote stale SPEC.md (v3.3.0->v4.1.0), removed suggest.md.
- [decision] 2026-07-25: upgraded `claude-env.ps1` for FreeModel 4-domain
  multi-tier support: normalize `/v1/messages` for api.freemodel.dev (canonical
  from guide.md), cc.freemodel.dev, api-cc.freemodel.dev, cc-t2.freemodel.dev.
  Added apiKeyHelper conflict detection: if `~/.claude/settings.json` has
  `apiKeyHelper` configured, automatically unset `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to
  eliminate the "Both apiKeyHelper and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set" warning.
  Updated `.env.template` with 3-tier VIP documentation (Standard/Mid/Top).
- [decision] 2026-07-25: **removed the Kilo CLI two-tier model split** — real
  usage showed `deepseek-v4-flash` unreliable, its token savings lost to
  re-prompting and orchestrator rework, and the routing choice itself a
  recurring source of judgment error. `tools/kilo_delegate.py` is now
  single-model: `deepseek-v4-pro` on every call with the guardrail preamble
  (renamed `CODE_TIER_GUARDRAIL` -> `GUARDRAIL`) always prepended; dropped
  `MODELS`/`classify_tier`; `--tier` kept as an ignored, deprecation-warning
  no-op so older callers don't break; usage log no longer writes `tier`.
  Cost optimization now comes only from flag discipline (`--tool-profile
  none --no-selfdev`, ~65% fewer input tokens), which costs no quality.
  Synced Kilo CLI defaults, README, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md + its generator
  template, and the skill across all 4 engines.
- [decision] 2026-07-25: fixed the `CLAUDE.md` generator gap found while
  doing the above. `claude_engine.py`'s `_CLAUDE_MD_TEMPLATE` had silently
  fallen behind the hand-edited live `CLAUDE.md`, so regenerating would
  have DELETED real content — exactly what the file's "do not edit by
  hand" banner is meant to prevent, with nothing verifying it. Ported the
  live content back into the template (regeneration is now lossless +
  idempotent) and added `garden.check_claude_md_regenerable()` so the
  divergence is loud drift instead of a silent landmine; extracted
  `_claude_md_counts()` so the checker renders the template exactly as the
  generator does. Also made generator writes LF-explicit (`_write_lf`):
  `Path.write_text` emits CRLF on Windows, which git hides here but
  `deploy.py` copies verbatim into non-git target projects. +3 tests (123).

- [decision] 2026-07-25: repaired `verify.sh` (6/31 -> 31/31 PASS). Root
  causes, all silent: (a) it probed `command -v python3`, which on Windows
  resolves to a Microsoft Store *stub* that exits with an install prompt --
  so every gated garden/test check "failed" while passing when run directly;
  now probes by executing `-c "import sys"`. (b) stale paths: `.claude/
  CLAUDE.md` -> `CLAUDE.md`, flat `.claude/skills/$sk.md` -> `$sk/SKILL.md`,
  `pytest tools/test_harness.py` (deleted v4.0.0) -> `pytest tools/ -q`,
  node guard test -> `pytest tools/test_claude_guard.py`. (c) the `socratic`
  keyword check was NOT stale -- CLAUDE.md genuinely lacked AGENTS.md's
  Complex Tasks section, so fixed the source template in `claude_engine.py`
  rather than deleting the check. Security: whitelisted vendored
  `antigravity-sdk-python-main` in security_scan SKIP_DIRS (fake fixture
  string) and added a `bcrypt/scrypt/argon2` gitleaks regex allowlist (it
  read password-hashing *prose* as an assignment). Fault-injected a real
  fake secret into both scanners afterward to prove they still fire -- an
  allowlist that disables detection is worse than the false positive.

- [decision] 2026-07-28: closed the **"docs assert infrastructure that
  does not exist"** class with 5 machine gates in `garden.py`, after it
  produced 6 separate bugs that every gate passed for months.
  `check_doc_counts()` (2026-07-26, counts resolve per engine),
  `check_doc_paths()` (cited path must resolve), `check_doc_flags()`
  (documented flag must exist), `check_enforcement_claims()` (a script
  called "blocking" must contain a non-zero exit), `check_skill_refs()`
  (a skill named as a skill must exist). What they caught: `.opencode/*`
  refs surviving the v4.0.0 engine removal; `.claude/state/` called "the
  existing convention" though `git log --all` shows it never existed;
  `tools/eval.py --check-triggers`; `garden.py --strict` on a script with
  zero argv handling; `quality-gate.js` promising to block a missing
  ALGO-CHECK tag while all 3 of its exits are `process.exit(0)`; and the
  router `using-agent-skills` pointing at 5 skills that never existed
  (104 refs x 4 engines) while real counterparts sat under other names.
  Design rule learned the hard way: **verify generously, flag narrowly.**
  Draft 1 of the flag check fired on real subcommand flags (fixed by
  unioning per-subcommand `--help` + source text, since hand-rolled argv
  parsers emit no help); draft 1 of the skill check matched bare
  kebab-case and returned 190 hits, nearly all npm packages and YAML keys
  -- requiring an explicit marker (`` `x` skill ``, `skills/x/SKILL.md`,
  or a router arrow on a line containing `?`) dropped it to 0 while still
  catching all 104. A gate that cries wolf gets disabled, so a false
  positive costs more than a miss. Every gate was fault-injected before
  commit. Standing limit, do not re-litigate without new evidence: these
  check that citations *resolve*, never that prose *descriptions* are
  accurate -- that needs semantics, i.e. an LLM, i.e. non-determinism, and
  a gate that fires only sometimes is worse than none.

- [decision] 2026-08-06: `claude-env.ps1` now supports explicit launcher
  profiles: `gateway` (default, FreeModel/third-party via `--bare`),
  `native` (full mode, prefer API key or `apiKeyHelper` if present), and
  `kilo` (full-mode alias for IDE-integrated Kilo workflows). This keeps the
  current Claude gateway path stable, avoids touching `COMMANDCODE_*`/`DEEPSEEK_*`, and makes Kilo-specific IDE integrations opt-in
  instead of overloading one implicit runtime path.   `gateway` still restores
  `CLAUDE.md` discovery with `--add-dir .`, but hooks/auto-memory remain a
  documented degraded mode under `--bare`.
- [decision] 2026-09-10: OpenCode no longer mirrors skills into
  `.opencode/skills/`. OpenCode natively loads `.opencode/skills/` AND the
  Claude-compatible `.claude/skills/`, and requires skill names to be unique
  across loaded locations; mirroring `.kilo/skill` into both registered every
  skill twice. It now relies on `.claude/skills/` alone;
  `tools/opencode_engine.prune_duplicate_skills()` removes any legacy
  `.opencode/skills/`, and `garden.check_opencode()` flags a stray one.
  `deploy.py --engine opencode` ships `.claude/skills/` (and no longer creates
  a stray `.claude/memory/`). Lint budget lowered 75->72 (one fewer
  `mcp-builder/scripts/evaluation.py` copy -> -3 S/BLE findings). Also:
  AGENTS.md + `harness-boundaries.md` corrected — `.opencode/` is a
  first-class engine (v4.2.0) that was only briefly removed, not current; and
  the `commandcode` model provider is a documented GLOBAL dependency (global
  OpenCode plugin) rather than declared in-repo.
- [decision] 2026-09-10: OpenCode skill invocation is gated from the source
  flag. OpenCode ignores Claude's `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter and
  has no user-only skill invocation, so
  `opencode_engine.collect_disabled_skills()` reads `.kilo/skill/*/SKILL.md`
  and emits `permission.skill[name] = "ask"` (with `"*": "allow"` first) in the
  generated `opencode.json`. 10 skills carry the flag; no tooling previously
  consumed it. #2 done: deleted the unused `@opencode-ai/plugin` dep from the
  untracked `.opencode/package.json` + node_modules (local-only).
- [decision] 2026-09-11: harness-consistency audit (F1-F10); full write-up in
  `docs/audit-2026-09-11.md`. Policy call to carry forward: skill data assets
  (`.xml`) are allowed only inside a `skill*/` directory — NOT added to
  `boundary_audit.HARNESS_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`, because a global extension
  entry would blind the audit to a stray file anywhere in a harness dir, which
  is the leak it exists to catch. Second call: the root `.harness.lock` is a
  SUPERSET of what deploy ships (this repo IS the harness), so it declares
  `.agents` (Antigravity's local junction) via a new
  `deploy.LOCAL_ONLY_HARNESS_DIRS` set — deliberately NOT in
  `EXCLUSIVE_HARNESS_DIRS`, whose members are eligible for full stale-cleanup
  and a locally-created junction at a target is not safe to wipe. `DIRS_ALL`
  still never includes `.agents`. **This supersedes the `--bare`-default
  described in the 2026-08-06 entry**: every launcher profile runs full mode by
  default since 2026-08-08; `--bare` is explicit opt-in.
- [decision] 2026-09-14: Codex CLI added as a harness-consumer engine
  (NOT a harness mirror — Codex reads `AGENTS.md` natively, so no `.codex/`
  engine dir is generated). Installed `@openai/codex` 0.154.0 (npm, global).
  Added `codex-env.ps1` (launcher) and `tools/codex_usage.py` (metering).
  Four findings, each verified by experiment, that a future session must not
  re-derive:
  1. **Codex never reads `.env`.** It resolves the key from the env var named
     by `env_key` in `~/.codex/config.toml`, and its base URL is a static
     config value. `codex-env.ps1` therefore loads `.env`, exports
     `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and passes the URL via
     `-c model_providers.freemodel.base_url=...`.
  2. **`${VAR}` interpolation does NOT work in `base_url`** — setting
     `base_url = "${OPENAI_BASE_URL}/v1"` fails with "stream disconnected
     before completion: builder error". Hence the `-c` override above.
  3. **Codex's "code mode" must be OFF.** With it on, the model is asked to
     emit free-form JS (`const r = await tools.exec_command({...})`), which the
     gateway's models do not understand: they reply in prose, no tool ever
     runs, and the turn ends having done nothing. Fix is
     `[features] code_mode.enabled = false` + `unified_exec = false`. This
     looks identical to "provider lacks function calling", but it is not —
     calling `/v1/responses` directly with a `tools` array returns a proper
     `function_call` item, so the provider is fine and the wire format was the
     problem.
  4. **Windows sandbox blocks every shell command** ("rejected: blocked by
     policy") even under `workspace-write`, leaving the agent unable to run
     tests or git. Set `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` +
     `approval_policy = "never"` (same trust model Claude Code/Kilo run under).
  Two smaller traps: `wire_api = "chat"` was **removed** in 0.154 (only
  `responses` remains), and TOML bare keys must precede the first `[table]`
  header — `sandbox_mode` placed after `[features]` lands inside it and Codex
  refuses to start.
- [decision] 2026-09-14: FreeModel gateway routing is NOT stable per model
  name — only `gpt-5.6-terra` is usable. This was measured objectively from
  API-side data (`usage.input_tokens` and the response's own `model` field),
  never by asking the model what it is. Method that produced the result:
  send one fixed 600-char string repeatedly and compare token counts; a stable
  backend returns identical counts and the same `model` id every time.
  Results: `gpt-5.6-terra` STABLE (150/150/150/150, and 150/181/94 for
  en/vi/code text across two passes each, always `served=gpt-5.6-terra`);
  `gpt-5.6-sol` UNSTABLE (150 vs 820 for identical text); `gpt-5.5` and
  `gpt-5.4` do not exist as distinct models — 4/4 requests for each were
  answered by `gpt-5.6-sol`, and both returned 150-vs-820 token spreads;
  `gpt-5.6-luna` is dead (HTTP 502 on 3 attempts spaced 5s apart).
  Tokenizer fingerprint for terra matches OpenAI's `o200k_base`
  (zh/en chars-per-token ratio 0.32; English 4.55 chars/token, Chinese 1.44,
  emoji 0.56), i.e. NOT a CJK-optimised tokenizer. Conclusion recorded for the
  pricing question: the gateway is a router over a pool ("routes each request
  to the best open model"), so "cheaper than buying direct" is not a
  like-for-like claim — the underlying model is anonymous and, for every alias
  except terra, changes between calls. Use terra for bulk mechanical work; do
  not use this gateway for work that needs reproducibility.
  **Measurement traps, do not repeat:** (a) asking the model to identify
  itself proves nothing; (b) four calls inside a few seconds do not
  demonstrate stability over time — vary the text and space the calls out
  (the sol/gpt-5.5 spread only shows up across repeats); (c) the response's
  `model` field is not a claim by the model, it is routing metadata, which is
  exactly why it is admissible evidence.
- [decision] 2026-09-14: Cost/metering path for Codex + FreeModel. FreeModel
  returns no cost field (its `/v1/responses` usage block carries tokens only,
  and `/api/billing` needs a browser session, not an API key), so
  `tools/codex_usage.py` computes cost from token counts times reference
  prices, and reads token/cache data from Codex's own rollout log —
  `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`, event type `token_usage_record`,
  which breaks out `cached_input_tokens` per API call with `usage` /
  `turn_token_usage` / `thread_token_usage` variants. No extra Codex config is
  needed to get this data. Cached input is 10x cheaper ($0.2/M vs $2/M on
  terra), so cache hit rate is the dominant cost lever; long sessions hold
  cache (measured 40-47%), many short sessions do not (0%). Plan arithmetic:
  $20/month buys a $20 allowance per rolling 5h window capped at $132/week
  (~$572/month of list-price value), so break-even is $4.62/week of value.
  Terra list prices used: $2/M in, $12/M out, $0.2/M cached.

- [decision] 2026-09-27: OpenCode v2 rejects V1 plugins by construction — the plugin API is
  the only intentional breaking change. A V1 default export
  (`export default function(){ return { config, auth } }`) raises
  `PluginModule.LoadError: Plugin must export a default definition with an id and
  an effect or setup function`. Verified on `commandcode-go-opencode-provider@0.4.0`
  under `@opencode/cli@2.0.18`: it can never load, which is why the harness
  retired it. Log lives at `~/.local/share/opencode/log/opencode.log`
  (grep `failed to load plugin`). The global `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`
  was migrated to V2-native `providers` (freemodel) with the plugin entry and its
  empty `commandcode` stub removed.

- [decision] 2026-09-28: `opencode.json` keeps `$schema: https://opencode.ai/config.json`
  even though that published schema is still V1-shaped (`agent`/`provider`/
  `permission` singular, `additionalProperties: false`). The V2 runtime reads the
  plural keys this engine emits, so the runtime is authoritative and the editor
  may flag three properties until upstream publishes a V2 schema. No V2 schema URL
  exists yet (`/v2/config.json`, `/config.v2.json`, `/schema/v2/config.json` all
  404).

- [decision] 2026-09-28: Removed the retired OpenCode v1 install from this machine:
  `opencode-ai@1.18.31` (npm global), `~/.opencode/` (a 224 MB self-updating
  install holding `bin/opencode.exe` v1.18.31 plus its own `node_modules`) and
  the now-dangling `~/.opencode/bin` entry in the User PATH. v2 stores nothing
  there — config `~/.config/opencode`, data `~/.local/share/opencode`, cache and
  binaries `~/.cache/opencode/bin`, state `~/.local/state/opencode` (per
  `opencode debug paths`). Gotcha: `npm uninstall -g opencode-ai` also deletes
  the `opencode` / `opencode.cmd` / `opencode.ps1` shims in the npm bin dir that
  `@opencode/cli` needs, and `opencode` then falls through to whatever is next on
  PATH. Restore them from the byte-identical `opencode2*` wrappers that
  `@opencode/cli` also installs, or reinstall the package. The guards in
  `opencode-env.ps1` and `tools/opencode_delegate.py` stay — they are now
  defensive rather than reparative.

- [decision] 2026-09-26: Feature/task state stays out of SQLite - eatures and
  shared_memory_* remain unused (no hook or engine calls set_feature_status()).
  AGENTS.md was still mandating the old API - requirement removed, API kept only
  for back-compat. Two session stores are documented as distinct:
  .solocode/shared-state.db (session_log + locks; writers pre_compact.py,
  codex_session.py) vs .solocode/sessions.db (session lifecycle/analytics;
  Claude hooks). Moved here 2026-10-06 to keep MEMORY.md under the 8,000-char gate.

- [decision] 2026-10-06: Antigravity CLI (agy.exe) auth and settings, from the
  official docs (antigravity.google/docs/cli/install, /reference, /features).
  The CLI stores a token profile in the OS keyring (Windows Credential Manager)
  and signs in silently; with none it opens a browser OAuth flow. There is no
  per-run account flag. `/logout` (TUI) purges the keyring profile; `/usage`
  (alias `/quota`) shows quota but is TUI-only. Headless/CI alternative: set
  `modelProvider: "gemini"` in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` and
  export `GEMINI_API_KEY` (only that var; `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `.env` are
  ignored); custom endpoint via `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`; `/logout` is a no-op
  there. Other settings keys: `permissions.allow`/`deny` (e.g. `command(git)`),
  `toolPermission` (default request-review), `useG1Credits` (external builds),
  `enableTerminalSandbox` (default false; AppContainer on Windows),
  `allowNonWorkspaceAccess` (default false). Plugins stage under
  `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/plugins/<name>/` (plugin.json + skills/agents/rules/hooks).

- [decision] The OpenCode `freemodel` provider was broken on three independent
  layers, each measured 2026-10-03 by experiment:
  1. `settings.baseURL` was `${OPENAI_BASE_URL}`, but `opencode-env.ps1` strips
     `/v1` from that var, so the provider POSTed to `.../chat/completions` and
     got `Error: not found`. The generator now emits `${OPENAI_BASE_URL}/v1`.
  2. Auth used `env: ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]`, which the built-in OpenAI provider also
     claims, and a FreeModel credential in OpenCode's own store overrides the
     provider env var: a stale stored key shadowed `.env` and returned
     `Unauthorized - Invalid token` while the same `.env` key worked via curl.
     The provider now reads a dedicated `FREEMODEL_API_KEY`, and the launcher
     clears the stored credential each launch
     (`opencode auth logout freemodel "API key"`, idempotent — with nothing
     stored it just reports the `FREEMODEL_API_KEY` fallback and exits non-zero).
  3. `opencode-env.ps1` set `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`, which turns a
     native command's stderr into a terminating error in Windows PowerShell 5.1:
     every `opencode-env.ps1 run ...` exited 1 with an empty `Write-Error`, for
     every provider. Lowered to `Continue` around the native call and success is
     read from `$LASTEXITCODE`.
  Debug technique worth reusing: `opencode run --standalone` bypasses the
  background server, and a local echo HTTP server reveals the exact request
  line, headers and `Authorization` header OpenCode sends.
  Model catalog: FreeModel's `/v1/models` is stale (lists dead `gpt-6-luna`,
  which answers 404, and omits `gpt-6.1-sol`). Declared models are `gpt-6-sol`,
  `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-6.1-sol`; every other name routes to `gpt-6-sol`
  server-side, so extra aliases add no capability.

## Pruned 2026-10-07 (mem cap)

Moved verbatim out of `MEMORY.md` to stay under the `memory_gate` hard cap.

- [decision] Claude launchers default to full mode; `--bare` is explicit
  degraded mode.
- [decision] Codex write path: verified that `Set-Content` is not blocked by
  Codex CLI; earlier failure was caused by compound commands ending in
  `Remove-Item -Force` triggering `exec_policy.rs` `rm -f` heuristic under
  `approval_policy = "never"`. Added verified write path to `tools/codex_guard.py`
  (`--write` flag with secret scanning and shared state file locking) alongside
  native `apply_patch` (2026-09-25). Moved here 2026-10-07: MEMORY.md was within
  19 bytes of the 8,000-char cap.

## Coverage ratchet reset (2026-10-07)

`tools/coverage_gate.py --update` was run to clear a long-standing failure.
Justification, in full:

- **Accepted (pre-existing, not from this session):**
  `tools/test_check_lint_budget.py` 98.63 -> 96.84. All three uncovered lines are
  unreachable by design: two are the `raise AssertionError(...)` bodies of the
  `boom` helpers that only run when the guard they assert has failed, one is the
  `sys.path.insert` branch never taken under pytest. `tools/deploy.py`
  41.25 -> 41.0: two tenths of a percent on 700 statements, no behaviour change;
  the real gap is 413 uncovered statements at 41%.
- **NOT accepted:** the `tools/garden.py` regression was caused by this series and
  was fixed with four real tests covering the new branches, clearing the gate on
  its own.
- **Collateral, and a tightening:** 28 files previously absent from the budget
  entered it, and 23 floors were raised because they were too low to mean
  anything — `.github/scripts/checklist.py` and `boundary_audit.py` were pinned at
  0.0 while measuring 39.8 and 45.5; `tools/claude_engine.py` went 37.72 -> 87.35.
- **Open debt:** 13 tracked files sit at 0.0%, meaning no test imports them:
  `codex_session`, `codex_usage`, `codex_verify`, `compaction`,
  `compaction_pruner`, `dsh_delegate`, `harness_config`, `kilo_server_manager`,
  `kilo_usage_report`, `session_analytics`, `solocode_config`,
  `.github/scripts/check_skips`, `.github/scripts/eval_harness`. A 0.0 floor is
  not a floor — the ratchet cannot detect a regression in any of them.

## Guard policy boundary + oracle result (2026-10-07)

Settled policy for the destructive-command guards (`.claude/hooks/guard.py` and
`.kilo/hooks/pre-tool-use/gate-guard.js`), now also stated in the corpus comment in
`tools/test_claude_guard.py`:

- **BLOCK** catastrophic or irreversible: a filesystem/system root, a whole system
  tree, a database, a device, a force-push (including the `+branch` refspec and
  bundled `-fu`), or a `sudo`/`env`-wrapped one of those.
- **ALLOW** routine, regenerable or targeted: a build directory, `node_modules`,
  one file, one temp file, a container run, a feature-branch push.
- `--force-with-lease` is deliberately ALLOWED at both call sites. It is the
  alternative this harness recommends, and the guards' own hint text tells people
  to use it. Do not "correct" this without changing that advice too.

Evidence for the boundary: an independent oracle (Gemini 3.8 Flash high,
generation-only, expected verdicts withheld) classified all 53 corpus commands
blind. It disagreed on 10; all 10 were strictness differences, and one was an
outright error (it allowed `git reset --har HEAD`, measured to discard staged
changes with exit 0). It found no defect, so it neither validates the corpus nor
replaces the behavioural parity test — it is recorded as the only independent
check that the boundary is not merely self-consistent.

Three rounds of guard defects were found in this series, and every round was found
by an adversary rather than by the author: 9 over-blocks, then 8 more defects plus
2 cross-engine divergences, then 10 oracle disagreements. The durable lesson:
change a guard with tests in BOTH directions and a different model reviewing it,
from the first commit.



## 2026-10-07 — OpenCode v2 provider routes (moved out of MEMORY.md)

- [decision] Step 5 Preview model routes (2026-10-06): four OpenCode v2 providers --
  `commandcode`, `freemodel`, `deepseek` (official), `openrouter` -- 31 models total.
  `_SMALL_MODEL` moved to `commandcode/deepseek-v4.1-flash`. Ids were verified live:
  the official DeepSeek API names V4.1 Flash **`deepseek-flash`** (reported name
  "DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash", ctx 1,048,576); the id `deepseek-v4.1-flash` exists on
  CommandCode (84 models) and OpenRouter (465 models). OpenRouter's endpoint is a
  fixed public constant; only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is secret. `Space Bunny Alpha` is
  absent from every catalog and was dropped. A new orchestrator agent `jev` routes
  between DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, Gemini/Antigravity, and OpenCode CLI.

## 2026-10-07 — Guard hardening: full finding list

Eight holes verified by execution and closed in both engines: `rm -rfv /`,
`rm / -rf`, `git push origin --delete main`, `irm|iwr … | iex`, `Clear-Disk`,
`reg delete`, `vssadmin delete shadows`.

Independent Codex (gpt-6.1-sol) review rounds found, and were fixed:
- over-block on quoted searches (`rg 'reg delete'`, `rg 'Clear-Disk'`,
  `rg 'git push origin --delete main'`) -> new patterns anchored to command position
- miss on `git push --delete origin main` (remote between flag and branch)
- over-block on `rm -rf ./build`, `rm -rf /home/..backup`,
  `rm -rf /home/../workspace/build` -> rm_relative_wildcard / rm_root_escape scoped
- Kilo-vs-Claude divergence on `bash -c 'rm -rf /'`, `sudo curl x | bash`,
  `bash -c 'curl x | bash'` -> JS gained a bash-c / wrapper prefix

Pre-existing gaps, verified present at HEAD, NOT caused by this change, still open:
- `rm -rf build /` (a root as the 2nd argument) — miss
- `rm -rf '/'` / `rm -rf "/"` (quoted root) — miss
- `rg 'git push --force origin main' .` and `git commit -m "git push --force origin main"`
  — over-block (unanchored force_push_*)
- `xargs -0 rm -rf /` and `git -C . push --force origin main` — miss
- `rm -rf /tmp/build`, `rm -rf /var/log/app.log`, `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build`
  — blocked by design (existing policy, matches the pinned corpus)

Also: `tools/coverage_gate.py` save_budget now writes LF (`newline="\n"`) so the
budget file stops contradicting .gitattributes on Windows; `.github/scripts/checklist.py`
pytest timeout raised 120s -> 300s.

### Guard review round 4 (Codex, 2026-10-07)

Fixed (was a self-inflicted divergence): `echo "bash -c 'rm -rf /'"` -- the JS
guard matched a quoted wrapper. The new `normalizeCommand` port handles it the
way guard.py's normalize_command does, so the JS `bash -c` prefix was removed
(and the curl wrapper prefix with it).

Still open, all pre-existing (verified at HEAD; a dedicated hardening task, out of
scope for this change):
- unanchored single-token patterns block a search that NAMES them:
  `rg 'Format-Volume'`, `diskpart`, `shutdown`/`reboot`/`halt`,
  `win_stop_computer`, `win_restart_computer`
- misses: `Remove-Item -Recurse C:\`, `rm -rf C:/Windows`, `rm / --verbose -rf`,
  `nohup git push … --force`, `curl … | env bash`
- policy over-blocks kept by design: `rm -rf /tmp/<x>`, `rm -rf /var/log/<x>`,
  `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force <dir>` (pinned by the corpus)

### Guard review rounds 5-6 (Codex, 2026-10-07)

Fixed: anchored `diskpart`, `shutdown|reboot|halt`, `Format-Volume`,
`Stop-Computer`, `Restart-Computer` to command position (over-blocks on
`rg 'Format-Volume'` and on commit messages naming them); `rm_flags_after_target`
now allows benign options around the target, and normalizeCommand unwraps
`nohup|nice|command|time` (`rm -v / -rf`, `rm / --verbose -rf`,
`nohup git push --force`); the curl pipe accepts `env [KEY=VAL...]`
(`curl ... | env FOO=1 bash`).

Still open (pre-existing; its own task, not this change):
- `rg 'DROP TABLE' .` and `rg 'Remove-Item x -Recurse -Force' .` block a search
  that only names them -- `drop_table` is deliberately unanchored so a quoted
  `psql -c "DROP TABLE ..."` still blocks; `win_remove_recursive` is unanchored.
- a separator inside quoted text is still read as executable:
  `rg 'echo x; diskpart' .` blocks (a `[;&|]` anchor cannot tell quoted from real).
- misses: `Remove-Item C:/ -Recurse` (root target), `rm -rf C:/Windows`
  (Windows system trees are absent from rm_system_dir).
- divergence: only the Python guard scans command text for secrets, so
  `echo API_KEY='...'` blocks under Claude, not Kilo (Kilo's secret scan is a
  separate hook) -- architectural.
