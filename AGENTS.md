# Solo-Code — AI Agent Harness (Root Rulebook)

> **CRITICAL:** Read this file fully before taking any action. These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

This file serves **Kilo** (reads `.kilo/` for hooks/skills/memory — source of truth), **Claude Code** (reads `.claude/` + `CLAUDE.md`, generated from `.kilo/`), **OpenCode** (reads `.opencode/` + `opencode.json`, generated from `.kilo/`; it also loads this file and the Claude-compatible `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` locations), and **GitHub Copilot** (reads `.copilot/` for agents/skills/commands, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for rulebook). Sections referencing `.kilo/` paths are Kilo-specific; other engines ignore them and use their own generated/mirrored equivalents. (`.opencode/` was removed in v4.0.0, then reintroduced in v4.2.0 as a first-class primary engine — see `.harness.lock`.)

**OpenCode v2 + model provider (self-contained):** this repo targets OpenCode v2 (`@opencode/cli`, plugin SDK `@opencode/plugin`), not the retired v1 line (`opencode-ai` / `@opencode-ai/plugin`). `.opencode/opencode.json` declares the `commandcode` provider itself under v2's `providers` key — an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `${COMMANDCODE_BASE_URL}` (`https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1`) authenticated by `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY`, listing the `commandcode/<id>` models the harness references (see `_PROVIDER_MODELS` in `tools/opencode_engine.py`). The root `opencode.json` is deliberately kept **v1-safe** (no `providers`, no `permissions` array; the gate uses the legacy `permission` object) because the host IDE Kilo Code ships OpenCode v1 as `kilo.exe`, whose `kilo config check` hard-rejects those v2-only keys — while OpenCode v2 maps and enforces the legacy shapes. Use `${NAME}` (server-environment placeholder), **not** `{env:NAME}`: v2 rejects `{env:...}` references in project config ("environment references are not allowed in project config"), so the launcher must export the variable to the OpenCode server. The v1 plugin `commandcode-go-opencode-provider` is no longer used. `opencode-env.ps1` exports the `.env` values and resolves the v2 `@opencode/cli` binary explicitly, because a stale v1 native binary can still sit on PATH. v2 loads only `AGENTS.md` (the `instructions` config array is accepted but not resolved), so `tools/opencode_engine.py` emits `.kilo/instruction/*.md` as on-demand skills under `.opencode/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` — loaded when the relevant file type is worked on — instead of carrying them eagerly.

## Harness Boundaries (READ FIRST)

> **DO NOT CONFUSE harness files with project source code.**

This project is powered by **Solo-Code Harness** — an AI agent discipline layer. When analyzing or modifying ANY file, first classify it:

| If the file path starts with... | Then it is... | Action |
|----------------------------------|---------------|--------|
| `.kilo/`, `.copilot/`, `.gemini/`, `.claude/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.opencode/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/` | Harness engine | Rules/skills/hooks for AI behavior — not project logic |
| `.contracts/` | Harness sub-agent contracts | Status contracts for delegated agents |
| `.github/`, `.vscode/`, `tools/` | **Shared** — harness *and* project | The harness ships files here, but the project also keeps its own CI workflows, `CODEOWNERS`, dependabot config, editor settings and dev scripts. Only the exact paths under `[shared_files]` in `.harness.lock` are harness; **everything else here is project code**. |
| `AGENTS.md`, `agent.yaml`, `kilo.jsonc`, `opencode.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.ruff.toml`, `.gitleaks.toml`, `Makefile`, `claude-env.ps1`, `codex-env.ps1`, `opencode-env.ps1`, `init.sh`, `verify.sh`, `extensions_config.json`, `.harness.lock`, `.solocode/`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | Harness config | Agent behavior configuration — not application config |
| **Everything else** | **Project code** | Your actual application — this is what you modify |

**Key rule:** Never modify harness files to fix a project bug. Never modify project files to fix a harness issue. Read `.harness.lock` for the authoritative boundary list.

## Self-Verification Handshake

When asked "Is Solo-Code Harness active?" or "What rules apply here?", answer:
`Solo-Code Harness active: behavior rules, anti-hallucination rules, security rules, prose quality rules, 53 skills, 15 agents, hooks enabled (Kilo) / guard + lifecycle hooks enabled (Claude Code). Use /verify to validate.`

## Escape Hatch (Meta-Principle)

> *"Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous."*
> — George Orwell, "Politics and the English Language" (1946), Rule 6

Rules are guides to quality and safety, not ends in themselves. When a rule fights the task, use judgment — but document the exception.

---

## Fresh Information First (ANTI-STALENESS)

**Your training data is a snapshot. SDKs and APIs change after your cutoff.**

Before using ANY library you're not 100% certain about:
1. **Verify it exists** — Check `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or existing imports
2. **Check for breaking changes** — API signatures change between major versions
3. **Mark uncertainty** — If unverified, tag `// VERIFY: <lib>.<symbol> against version X`
4. **Search docs first** — Use MCPs (context7) or `webfetch` to confirm current API before writing code

---

## Surgical Changes (TOUCH ONLY WHAT YOU MUST)

- **Don't "improve" adjacent code** — Your job is the requested change, not a style overhaul
- **Don't refactor things that aren't broken** — Refactoring is a separate task
- **Match existing style** — Consistency within a file beats your preference
- **Clean up only your own mess** — Remove only what YOUR changes made unused
- **Every changed line should trace to the user's request** — If you can't explain why a line changed, don't change it

---

## Request Classification (STEP 1 — BEFORE ANY TOOL)

| Type             | Trigger                                   | Action                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **QUESTION**     | "what is", "explain", "how does"          | Text only. No tools unless reading files is essential. |
| **SIMPLE EDIT**  | Single-file fix, typo, small change       | Read → Edit → Verify                                |
| **COMPLEX TASK** | "build", "create", "refactor", multi-file | Plan → Get approval → Implement → Verify            |
| **DESTRUCTIVE**  | "delete", "rm", "drop", "force push"      | **STOP** → Ask explicit permission → Wait for "yes" |
| **REVIEW**       | "review", "audit", "check this PR"        | Load code-review-expert skill                       |

---

## Behavior Rules (MANDATORY)

### Safety

1. **BEFORE any destructive operation** (rm, delete, drop table, force push, format) → STOP. Ask explicit Yes/No. Do NOT proceed until user says "yes".
2. **BEFORE committing or pushing** → Scan the diff for secrets. Refuse to commit if secrets detected. Run `python .github/scripts/security_scan.py .` on the full diff.
3. **Never use destructive git commands** (`push --force`, `reset --hard`, or the `+` refspec like `git push origin +main`) unless user explicitly requests them. Never force-push to main/master.
4. **Do NOT use language runtimes (python, node, etc.) to bypass bash permission restrictions.** If you need to do something destructive, use the intended bash tool and go through the permission guard.

### Code Quality

5. **ALWAYS read a file before editing it.** Blind writes cause stale-read errors.
6. **Use exact string replacement** (Edit tool) over full-file rewrites. Smaller diffs = lower risk.
7. **Preserve existing patterns.** Before writing new code, analyze 3-5 nearby files to identify: naming conventions, indentation style, import ordering, error handling approach, paradigm (FP vs OOP), and test patterns. Match what you find. Never introduce new conventions. When the codebase is inconsistent, follow the most recently modified files.
8. **Never leave broken code.** After any edit, verify syntax. After any feature, run tests.

### AI Discipline (Anti-Hallucination)

These rules prevent AI from generating plausible-looking but incorrect code. Violation risks silent errors that compile but fail at runtime.

A-1. **Verify library existence before using it.** Check `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, or imports for the actual installed version. If you cannot verify, mark `// VERIFY: <lib>.<symbol> against version X` and flag the uncertainty.
A-2. **No invented function signatures, parameter names, or return types.** Never guess a library's API. If the library isn't in the project, propose installing it before writing code that depends on it. Silent stubs are worse than refusal.
A-3. **Compiling does not mean correct.** Confirm the code does what its name promises, not just what it returns. Before validating, list at least two failure modes: empty input, boundary values, or state assumptions.
A-4. **No restated-code comments.** Comments must explain WHY, not paraphrase WHAT the code does. A comment repeating the code is noise. Never write self-referential comments like "used by X flow" or "added for issue Y" — those belong in commit messages.
A-5. **Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly.** If you do not know something, say "I do not know" or "I need to verify X". Do not invent a plausible-sounding answer. When generating code with hidden trade-offs (new dependency, async pattern, data structure choice), name the trade-off in the response.
A-6. **Loop detection (DeerFlow threshold).** If the same tool is called 3+ times consecutively with the same parameters, change strategy immediately. At 5+ consecutive identical tool calls — stop, report the loop to the user, and wait for instruction. The `context-monitor.js` hook in `.kilo/hooks/post-tool-use/` enforces this automatically.

### Prose Quality (MANDATORY)

Inspired by *"The Elements of Agent Style"* (Zhao, 2026). These rules reduce AI-tell patterns in all technical prose output.

| # | Rule | Severity |
|---|------|----------|-------------|
| 9 | **Cut needless words** — never use "in order to" (→ "to"), "due to the fact that" (→ "because"), "at this point in time" (→ "now"), "it is important to note that" (→ delete), "may potentially" (→ "may"). | `high` |
| 10 | **Drop dying metaphors** — never use "pushes the boundaries", "paradigm shift", "state of the art", "cutting edge", "paves the way", "unlock the potential", "game changer". Replace with specific numbers or mechanisms. | `high` |
| 11 | **Use concrete terms** — replace "factors", "aspects", "considerations" with the specific items they refer to. "Performance issues" → "p95 latency rose from 120ms to 450ms". | `high` |
| 12 | **Prefer plain English** — "use" over "leverage"/"utilize"; "method" over "methodology"; "feature" over "functionality"; "because" over "due to the fact that". | `medium` |
| 13 | **No transition-word openers** — avoid "Additionally", "Furthermore", "Moreover", "In addition" at sentence start. | `medium` |
| 14 | **Varied sentence starts** — never open two consecutive sentences with the same word (especially "This", "It", "We", "The"). | `medium` |
| 15 | **Support claims with evidence** — never write "prior work shows" or "recent studies suggest" without naming the source. Never fabricate citations. Mark unverified claims `[UNVERIFIED]`. | `critical` |
| 16 | **Split long sentences** — split sentences over 30 words. Vary sentence length across paragraphs (mix short declarative with longer qualifying ones). | `high` |

#### BAD → GOOD Examples

- BAD: `This PR makes minor adjustments to fix an issue causing test failures.`
- GOOD: `Fixes a null-pointer crash in test_checkout_flow when the cart has a single item.`
- BAD: `We leverage state-of-the-art embedding models to unlock the retrieval pipeline's potential.`
- GOOD: `We use text-embedding-3-large, raising recall@10 by 7 points over ada-002.`

### Skills

Auto-loaded skills: `code-review-expert`, `file-editor-pro`, `git-workflow-master`, `permission-guard`, `systematic-debugging`, `brainstorming`, `testing-patterns`, `api-patterns`, `solo-code-harness`. Load via `kilo.json` instructions or context matching.

### Complex Tasks

17. **Socratic Gate:** For complex requests ("build X", "create Y", "refactor Z"), ask at least 2 clarifying questions before coding. Confirm approach, tradeoffs, and edge cases.
18. **Plan before implement:** Break complex tasks into steps. Present the plan. Wait for approval. Then execute.
19. **Synthesize, don't delegate blindly:** When spawning sub-agents (Task tool), read their findings and write specific implementation instructions with file paths and line numbers.

---

## Security Rules

See `.kilo/instruction/security-patterns.md` for full security rules — auto-loaded when editing auth, controllers, middleware, config, or `.env` files.

Key enforcement points:
- **ALL user input is untrusted** — validate type, length, format, and range
- **Use parameterized queries** for SQL — never string interpolation
- **Never hardcode credentials** — use environment variables
- **Passwords** must use bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 — never MD5/SHA1

---

## Session State Lifecycle (shared state)

Cross-engine session state lives in `.solocode/shared-state.db` (SQLite, local-only,
never committed). Engines read/write it via `tools/shared_state.py`'s `SharedState`
class. Claude Code hooks write to it automatically (`pre_compact.py` logs a
compaction checkpoint); engines without a lifecycle hook call `tools/shared_state.py`
directly (for example `tools/codex_session.py` for Codex).

**Feature/task tracking is NOT in SQLite.** The `features` and `shared_memory_*`
tables remain for backward compatibility but are unused: no hook or engine calls
`set_feature_status()`. Track tasks with `git log` and record conventions, gotchas
and decisions in `.kilo/memory/MEMORY.md`. `set_feature_status()` still exists as an
API but is not part of the current workflow.

### Startup

1. `session_start.py` injects a summary into context: git branch/sha/dirty count,
   recent sessions, any unseen Gemini/Antigravity handoff report, and a PreCompact
   recovery checkpoint (`.solocode/context-checkpoint.json`) if one was left.
2. Read `git log --oneline -10` and `.kilo/memory/MEMORY.md` to see what is in
   progress. Do not wait for an `in-progress` feature row — there is none.

### Wrap-Up (before ending session)

1. **Log the session**: `state.add_session_entry(engine=..., model=..., summary="...")`
   (newest entries are read first at next session start). `pre_compact.py` does this
   automatically on Claude Code; other engines call `tools/shared_state.py` directly
   if no lifecycle hook exists for that engine.
2. **Record settled decisions** in `.kilo/memory/MEMORY.md`'s `## Decisions` section
   (see the compaction section below).

### Context Compaction Continuity (CRITICAL — read this before/after any compaction)

Long sessions eventually get their context auto-summarized ("compacted"). A
compaction summary lives only in the current session's context — it is NOT
automatically written into the project's durable memory. **Any settled
architectural/scope decision must be appended to `.kilo/memory/MEMORY.md`'s
`## Decisions` section (source of truth) BEFORE it would only exist inside a
soon-to-be-compacted summary.** Do this proactively, not just when reminded:

1. Whenever a real decision is settled (not just "in progress" work) —
   architecture choice, engine/tool adoption, a fix that changes established
   behavior, a policy change — append a one-entry bullet to `.kilo/memory/MEMORY.md`
   `## Decisions` immediately, don't wait until end of session.
2. Regenerate/sync after: `python tools/generate_harness.py --harness claude`
   (updates `.claude/memory/`), then manually copy to `.copilot/memory/`
   (no auto-generator exists for Copilot; `.gemini/` has no comparable
   memory mirror — see `tools/garden.py`'s `check_gemini()`).
3. Claude Code has a `PreCompact` hook (`.claude/hooks/pre_compact.py`) that
   fires right before compaction: it logs an objective checkpoint (git
   branch/sha, trigger type, timestamp) to `.solocode/shared-state.db` and
   emits a reminder — but it CANNOT write your decision prose for you (a
   hook is a deterministic script, not the model). Treat its reminder as a
   prompt to check step 1, not a substitute for it.
4. Other engines without a compaction-specific hook should apply this rule
   manually: whenever a session naturally runs long, checkpoint decisions to
   `MEMORY.md` rather than relying on the engine's own summarization.

### Executor mode (write gate, default ON)

`.solocode/executor-mode` toggles whether the orchestrator (Claude Code or
Kilo Code) may call `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit` directly. **Default is ON**:
absent or unreadable state file means the gate is active — fail closed, not
open, so a fresh clone or a deleted toggle cannot silently disable it. Bash
is never gated — the orchestrator still runs its own verification gates.

Enforced independently by each engine's own hook so neither can bypass it
by switching engines:

- Claude Code: `.claude/hooks/guard.py` (`PreToolUse`, matcher
  `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`).
- Kilo Code: `.kilo/hooks/pre-tool-use/executor-mode.js` (same matcher,
  wired into every `hooks.json` profile except `minimal`).

When ON, a write attempt is blocked (exit 2) with a reminder to verify the
result of any delegated work (`git status`/`git diff`) rather than trust a
worker's own report of what it wrote. `.gemini/antigravity/handoff/inbox/`
and `.solocode/executor-mode` itself are exempt — delegating a plan and
toggling the gate off must both stay possible from inside a gated session.

To disable: `echo off > .solocode/executor-mode`. Accepted off-values:
`off`, `0`, `disabled`, `false`, `no` (case-insensitive, trailing `#
comment` ignored). Any other value, including an empty file, keeps the
gate closed.

### Choosing a worker engine (routing table)

Three workers are available. Propose one **proactively** when the work fits —
the user should not have to remember they exist. `session_start.py` announces
each engine's availability at session start; treat that as a prompt to
consider delegation, not an instruction to always delegate.

| Work shape | Route to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Read >5 files, then summarize/compare/audit | **Antigravity CLI** | Large context through a headless worker |
| Repo-wide survey — "where else does X appear?" | **Antigravity CLI** | Breadth is exactly its edge |
| Independent review of a design or diff | **Antigravity CLI** | A second model catches different things |
| UI verification, screenshots, recordings | **Antigravity GUI handoff** | The CLI cannot verify a rendered UI |
| Small mechanical edit, boilerplate, one test | **OpenCode CLI** | Headless — costs the user nothing |
| Scoped code writing behind an explicit fence | Antigravity CLI if broad, OpenCode CLI if narrow | Both need the fence stated in writing |
| Architecture / product / security decisions | **Neither — do it here** | Judgment is not delegable |
| Anything needing this conversation's history | **Neither — do it here** | Workers are context-blind |

OpenCode CLI, Kilo CLI, and Antigravity CLI are headless. **OpenCode CLI is the
primary narrow executor and the orchestrator that plans and routes work**;
Antigravity CLI executes read-heavy or broad scopes via
`tools/antigravity_delegate.py`. Writes require `--auto-approve` and an explicit
`--allow-dir`; the wrapper takes a shared-state directory lock and checks the
post-run workspace scope. Antigravity GUI handoff remains a fallback for UI work.

**Verification is mandatory.** Every controlled test of worker engines
produced at least one error invisible in their own self-summary. Their
evidence is reliable; their self-assessment is not. Re-run their commands,
run the real gates, and mutation-test any new check they write.

Full decision guide: `.kilo/skill/gemini-delegation/SKILL.md`.

### Delegating to Antigravity CLI

Use the wrapper for normal headless work:

```powershell
# Read-only, generation only: no permission-skipping flag is sent.
python tools/antigravity_delegate.py "<task>" --model gemini-3.8-flash-medium

# Read-only WITH tool use (greps, tests, git status) but still no write scope.
python tools/antigravity_delegate.py "<audit>" --allow-tools --model gemini-3.8-flash-medium

# Write: explicit scope and opt-in auto approval are both required.
python tools/antigravity_delegate.py "<task>" --allow-dir src --auto-approve --model gemini-3.8-flash-high
```

**Headless tool permissions.** A plain read-only run cannot prompt for the
`command` permission, so a task that needs `run_command` is auto-denied. agy
still reports `status: SUCCESS` in that case, so the wrapper now inspects
`denied_actions` and per-tool errors and exits **5** (empty output exits **2**; a
suspected exhausted quota exits **6** — see the auth note below) instead of
returning a silent empty success. Pass `--allow-tools` to auto-approve
read/execute tools
without a write scope; it does not take a directory lock and does not run the
scope audit. `--allow-tools` cannot be combined with `--auto-approve`,
`--allow-dir`, or `--no-guardrail`.

**Pick the model by task complexity.** Gemini 3.8 Flash ships three reasoning
levels as distinct model ids; all three draw the same account quota, so the
cheapest one that fits the task is the right one:

| Task complexity | Model id | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanical, single-file, low reasoning | `gemini-3.8-flash-low` | Rename a symbol, reformat a table |
| Default multi-file work | `gemini-3.8-flash-medium` | Summarize 10 files, apply a scoped refactor |
| Hard reasoning, design-adjacent | `gemini-3.8-flash-high` | Independent design review, subtle bug hunt |

**Account quota and rotation.** `agy` keeps a token profile in the OS keyring
(Windows Credential Manager) and has **no per-run account flag**. Switch account
with `/logout` in the CLI then sign in again; check remaining quota with
`/usage`. Resume an interrupted task with `--conversation <id>` (the wrapper
prints the id) or `--continue-latest`. For unattended runs, a Gemini API key is
the documented headless alternative (`modelProvider: "gemini"` + `GEMINI_API_KEY`
in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`); least-privilege command allowlists
go in the same file under `permissions.allow`. Rotation is serial, so do not
queue unattended long batches across a quota boundary. Details:
`.kilo/skill/gemini-delegation/SKILL.md`.

The orchestrator must still inspect `git diff` and run the relevant tests,
security scan, and checklist. Never use `--no-guardrail` with `--auto-approve`.
The post-run scope check audits `--target-dir` only: it cannot see writes outside
that directory and cannot undo a write. `--auto-approve` still passes
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` to `agy.exe`, so `--allow-dir` is the fence, not
a sandbox.

**Maximize Antigravity CLI use.** Route all read-heavy, broad, or independent
tasks to it — reading >5 files, repo-wide surveys, independent review, and
read-only gate runs (`--allow-tools`). This cannot be hard-enforced: no hook
blocks a direct multi-file read, so it stays a routing policy plus the
session-start reminder, not a gate.

### Delegating to Antigravity GUI (manual fallback)

Use this path when GUI or visual verification is required. A human
must relay the task to the Antigravity IDE manually.
To minimize copy-paste, use the file-based handoff protocol instead of
pasting plan/result text through chat:

1. Write the plan to `.gemini/antigravity/handoff/inbox/<slug>-plan.md`
   (see `.gemini/antigravity/handoff/README.md` for the exact format).
2. Tell the user the one line to relay: *"Open Antigravity, tell Gemini to
   read `.gemini/antigravity/handoff/inbox/<slug>-plan.md` and write its
   report to `.gemini/antigravity/handoff/outbox/<slug>-report.md`."*
3. `.claude/hooks/session_start.py` auto-detects new `outbox/*-report.md`
   files at the next session start and announces them — no need to ask the
   user to paste the result back.

**Writing the brief** — four rules, each from an observed failure:

1. **Fence the scope, and predict the red gate.** If a correct result will
   make a check fail, say so explicitly ("that failure is the expected,
   correct outcome") — otherwise Gemini helpfully fixes what it was told
   only to detect.
2. **Demand evidence, not confidence.** A "Confident? Y/N" column came back
   22-for-22 "Yes", including on a wrong finding. Use `| Claim | Command run
   | Output |` and add: *"Do not write a claim you did not run a command for."*
3. **Name every writable path, including the brief itself.** The handoff
   README permits editing `status:`; a brief saying "touch nothing but the
   report" contradicts it. Say *"Do NOT edit this file. Leave `status:
   pending`."*
4. **Give the measurement, never the answer.** `ls .kilo/skill | wc -l`, not
   "there are 51". A brief that leaks the expected number cannot detect that
   the number changed.

**Before delegating a write**: take a `tools/shared_state.py` lock for the
files in scope — Gemini edits the same working tree concurrently, and
`acquire_lock()` returns `False` on a cross-engine conflict.

For headless writes, do not bypass the wrapper's directory lock or guardrail.
Use `agy.exe --print --output-format stream-json` through
`tools/antigravity_delegate.py`. Full guide:
`.kilo/skill/gemini-delegation/SKILL.md`.

## Git Commit Convention

End commit message with: `Co-Authored-By: Solo-Code <admin@solo-code.com>`

See `.kilo/skill/git-workflow-master/SKILL.md` for full commit format, types, and style rules.

---

## Memory System

Persistent memory at `.kilo/memory/`. The AI reads `MEMORY.md` at session start. Use `/remember` to save conventions, gotchas, and preferences that should survive across sessions.

---

## Automation Scripts

| Script                             | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/scripts/checklist.py`     | Master validation: security → lint → test → build |
| `.github/scripts/security_scan.py` | Scan for hardcoded secrets and unsafe patterns    |

Run: `python .github/scripts/checklist.py .`

---

## Known Constraints

- **No runtime bypass**: Do not use `node`, `python` to bypass bash permission restrictions
- **Windows shell**: Commands run in PowerShell, not bash. Use `; if ($?) { }` not `&&`
- **Prefer specialized tools**: Use `Read`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep` — never `Get-Content`, `Set-Content`, `Select-String`
- **Security scan required**: `python .github/scripts/security_scan.py .` must pass before any commit
- **No undocumented file creation**: Never create *.md documentation unless explicitly requested

---

## Not Allowed

These actions are prohibited regardless of permission mode:

- Modifying `.github/workflows/` or CI/CD pipeline configuration without explicit instruction
- Installing new npm/pip/cargo dependencies without explicit instruction
- Modifying `.kilo/hooks/hooks.json` hook configuration
- Editing `.kilo/instruction/security-patterns.md` security rules
- Deleting any file without explicit user approval
- Force-pushing to `main` or `master` branches
- Using `git commit --no-verify` or `git commit -n`

---

## Escalation

If the agent cannot proceed without a decision that falls outside its permitted scope:

1. **Stop** — do not make assumptions or guess.
2. **Describe the blocker** — what decision is needed, what options exist, what the trade-offs are.
3. **Wait for explicit instruction** — do not proceed until the user responds.

---

## Verification Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:
- [ ] `python .github/scripts/security_scan.py .` passes
- [ ] `python .github/scripts/checklist.py .` passes
- [ ] `python .github/scripts/check_skips.py tools/` passes (0 unauthorized skips)
- [ ] No console.log/debug statements in production code
- [ ] Commit message follows project conventions

---

## Language

When user speaks Vietnamese → respond in Vietnamese. Code comments and variable names remain in English.
